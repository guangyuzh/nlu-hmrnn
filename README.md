# Word and Constituent Boundaries in Hierarchical Multiscale Recurrent Neural Networks

### Branches under development
* Parser benchmark on Penn Treebank: [ptb](https://github.com/guangyuzh/nlu-hmrnn/tree/ptb)
* Question Answering: [train_qa](https://github.com/guangyuzh/nlu-hmrnn/tree/train_qa)

### References
* [hierarchical-rnn](https://github.com/n-s-f/hierarchical-rnn) package
* [Hierarchical Multiscale Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01704)

### Corpus
* **[Text8](https://github.com/guangyuzh/nlu-hmrnn/blob/master/hierarchical-rnn/text8.txt)** 
* **Penn Treebank** partially available from [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/)
```python
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download()
...
Identifier> treebank
```
* Generate groundtruth boundary labels from Penn Treebank under `treebank/`:
`python convert_boundary.py --path TARGET_PATH --threshold MIN_TOKENS`

### Next steps
1. F1 score of HM-RNN boundary detection:
    1. (*finished*) Convert parsing in PTB to 1s/0s boundary indicators, and use that as ground truth boundaries
    2. (*finished*) Test trained HM-LSTM models on PTB, and store layer-wise indicators
    3. (*finished*) calculate F1 scores of HM-LSTM for some layerâ€™s boundary indicators (*TODO: plot fancy figures*)
    3. (*finished*) Calculate BPC (LM evaluation metric) by these HM-LSTM on PTB
    4. Compare the correlation/trending of F1 and BPC

1. Statistically analyze with PCFG from PTB:
    1. Focus on improving syntactic meanings of HM-LSTM boundary indicators
    2. Compute PCFGs from PTB
    3. Find out if/what constituencies detected by HM-LSTM boundary coincide with PCFGs
