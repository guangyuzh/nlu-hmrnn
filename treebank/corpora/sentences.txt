x by hollingsworth vose co was under contract ichx with lorillard to make the cigarette filters the finding probably will support those who tx argue that the us should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos chrysotile found in most schools and other buildings dr talcott said x tx the us is one of the few industrialized nations that tx does nt have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth needlelike fibers such as crocidolite that tx are classified x as amphobiles according to brooke t mossman a professor of pathlogy at the

filters were exposed x to asbestos in the xxxxs areas of the factory ichx were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used x tx workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters workers described clouds of blue dust that tx hung over parts of the factory even

of state has kicked off an issue at the big board here tx anything s possible how about the new guinea fund quips tx george foot a managing partner at newgate management associates of northampton mass the recent explosion of country funds mirrors the closedend fund mania of the xxxxs mr foot says x tx when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular tx they fell into oblivion after the xxxx crash unlike traditional openend mutual funds most of these onecountry portfolios are the closedend type x issuing a fixed number of shares that txx trade publicly the surge brings to nearly xx the number of country funds that txx are rnrx or soon will be rnrx listed x in new york or london these funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets people are looking x to stake their claims now before the number of available nations runs out says tx michael porter an analyst at smith barney harris upham co new york behind all the hoopla is tx some heavyduty competition as individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years securities firms have scrambled x to find new products that brokers find txx easy x to sell tx and the firms are stretching their nets far and wide x to do it financial planners often urge investors x to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities and many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets such as the us and japan country funds offer an easy way x to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies tx but it does nt take much to get burned x political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds another concern the funds share prices tend x to swing more than the broader market when the stock market dropped nearly x oct xx tx for instance the mexico fund plunged about xx and the spain fund fell xx and most country funds were clobbered xx more than most stocks after the xxxx crash what ichx txx s so wild about the funds frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios after x trading at an average discount of more than xx in late xxxx and part of last year country funds currently trade at an average premium of x the reason share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks x they hold tx it s probably worth paying a premium for funds that txx invest in markets that txx are partially closed to foreign investors such as south korea some specialists say x tx but some european funds recently have skyrocketed spain fund has surged to a startling xxx premium it has been targeted xx by japanese investors as a good longterm play tied to xxxx s european economic integration and several new funds that txx are nt even fully invested yet have jumped x to trade at big premiums i m very alarmed x to see these rich valuations says tx smith barney s mr porter the newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds mr porter suggests x tx unlike many us investors those in asia or europe seeking foreignstock exposure may be less resistant to paying higher prices for country funds there may be an international viewpoint cast x on the funds listed here mr porter says tx nonetheless plenty of us analysts and money managers are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country funds they argue that us investors often can buy american depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds these socalled adrs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the us that way investors can essentially buy the funds without x paying the premium for people who txx insist on x jumping in now x to buy the funds newgate s mr foot says the only advice x i have tx for these folks is that those who tx come to the party late had better x be ready x to leave quickly the us and soviet union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by moscow of xxx million u in precommunist russian debts owed to the us government the state department said x tx if the debts are repaid xx it could clear the way x for soviet bonds to be sold xx in the us tx however after two meetings with the soviets a state department spokesman said that it expx s too early to say whether that will happen coincident with the talks the state department said x it has permitted a soviet bank to open a new york branch the branch of the bank for foreign economic affairs was approved x last spring and opened in july but a soviet bank here would be crippled xx unless moscow found a way x to settle the xxx million u debt which tx was lent xx to the country s shortlived democratic kerensky government before the communists seized power in xxxx tx under a xxxx law the johnson debt default act as amended x it expx s illegal for americans to extend credit to countries in default to the us government unless they are members of the world bank and international monetary fund the ussr belongs to neither organization moscow has settled prexxxx debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value the state department stressed the prexxxx debts as the key to satisfying the johnson act but the soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the us until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the world war ii lendlease program in another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed x to rise in september meanwhile the national association of purchasing management said x its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in october for the sixth consecutive month its index inched up

jenrette securities corp i do nt see any signs that inventories are excessive a soft landing is an economic slowdown that txx eases inflation without x leading to a recession the department said x

evidence that inflation is under control for the fifth consecutive month purchasing managers said x prices for the goods x they purchased tx fell the decline was even steeper than in september they also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly ichx in october than they had for each of the five previous months economists consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating

thing says tx the kicker both these candidates are named x rudolph giuliani who s tx telling the truth everybody and nobody it s a classic situation of ads that txx are true but not always fully accurate mr dinkins did fail x to file his income taxes for four years but he insists x he voluntarily admitted the oversight when he was being considered x for a city job tx he was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems but he insists x he made no secret of it the city s campaign finance board has refused x to pay mr dinkins xxxxx u in matching funds because his campaign

reservations about the language in the legislation democratic lt gov douglas wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with republican marshall coleman with an abortion commercial produced by frank greer that analysts of every political persuasion agree x tx was a tour de force against a shot of monticello superimposed on an american flag an announcer talks about the strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty that virginians have nurtured tx for generations then just as an image of the statue of thomas jefferson dissolves from the screen the announcer continues on the issue of abortion marshall coleman wants x to take away your right to choose and x give it to the politicians that commercial which txx said x mr coleman wanted x to take away the right of abortion even in cases of rape and incest a charge x mr coleman denies tx changed the dynamics of the campaign x transforming it at least in part into a referendum on abortion the ad prompted mr coleman the former virginia attorney general to launch a series of advertisements created by bob goodman and designed x to shake mr wilder s support among the very women who txx were attracted x by the abortion ad the coleman counterattack featured a closeup of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal a voice says cmon now do nt you have boyfriends then an announcer interjects it was douglas wilder who txx introduced a bill x tx to force rape victims age xx and younger to be interrogated x about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists so the next time x mr wilder talks about the rights of women tx ask him about this law x he tried x to pass tx mr wilder did introduce such legislation xx years ago but he did so at the request of a constituent a common legislative technique used by lawmakers the legislation itself noted that it was introduced x by request and in xxxx mr wilder introduced a bill x tx to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation people have grown tired of these ads and coleman has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner says tx mark rozell a political scientist at mary washington college wilder has managed x to get across the idea that coleman will say anything x to get elected x governor and more important has been able x to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on coleman mr coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning but the truce lasted only hours by tuesday night television stations were carrying new ads featuring mr coleman himself raising questions about mr wilder s sensitivity to rape victims the attacks began when democratic rep james florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of pinocchio and a photograph of mr florio s rival republican rep jim courter remember pinocchio says tx a female voice consider jim courter and then this commercial produced by bob squier gets down to its own mean and dirty business pictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus and the female voice purrs that hazardous waste on his lcb mr courter s rcb property the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud and the nose on mr courter s face grows the only fraud involved cry tx mr courter s partisans is the florio commercial itself and so the courter campaign has responded with its own pinocchio commercial produced by mr ailes in this one the screen fills with photographs of both candidates who tx s really lying asks tx a female voice florio s lying the voice goes on because the barrel on courter s land contained heating oil was cleaned x up and caused no pollution mr courter s long nose shrinks while mr florio s grows who tx s telling the truth stephen salmore a political scientist at new jersey s eagleton institute says x it s another example of an ad that tx s true but not fully accurate barrels were dumped x on the courter property a complaint was made x but there is no evidence x the barrels were a serious threat to the environment even so according to mr salmore the ad was devastating because it raised questions about mr courter s credibility but it s building on a long tradition in xxxx on

manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for laborintensive production these nations known as asia s little tigers also are contributing to southeast asia s integration but their influence will remain subordinate to japan s for recipient countries such as thailand and malaysia the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth but asian nations harsh memories of their military domination by japan in the early part of this century make them fearful of falling under japanese economic hegemony now because of budget constraints in washington the us encourages japan to share

because teachers often teach the test as mrs yeargin did although most are never caught x evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so california s education

spring south carolina s reforms were designed x for schools like greenville high school x standing on a shaded hill in a rundown area of this old textile city the school has educated many of south

honors programs mrs ward took over in xxxx x becoming the school s seventh principal in xx years her immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown prior to his term a teacher bled to death in the halls x stabbed x by a student academically mrs ward says x tx the school was having trouble x serving in harmony its two disparate and evenly split student groups a privileged white elite from old monied neighborhoods and blacks many of them poor from rundown inner city neighborhoods mrs ward resolved x to clean out deadwood in the school s faculty and restore safety and she also had some new factors working in her behalf one was statewide school reform which txx raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment another was nancy yeargin who txx came to greenville in xxxx x full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted x to reward tx being a teacher just became my life says tx the xxyearold mrs yeargin a teacher for xx years before

learned in other classes says tx kelli green a greenville senior in the classroom students say x tx mrs yeargin distinguished herself by varying teaching approaches x forcing kids to pair up x to complete classroom work or using collegebowl type competitions on weekends she came to work x to prepare study plans or sometimes even x to polish the furniture in her classroom she just never gave it up says tx mary marchand mary beth s mother you d see her correcting homework in the stands at a football game some fellow teachers however viewed mrs yeargin as cocky and too yielding to students mrs ward says x she often defended her to colleagues who txx called her a grandstander pressures began x to build friends told her x she was pushing too hard because of deteriorating hearing she told colleagues x she feared x she might not be able x to teach much longer mrs yeargin s extra work was also helping her earn points in the state s incentivebonus program but the most important source of points was student improvement on tests huge gains by her students in xxxx and xxxx meant a total of xxxx u in bonuses over two years a meaningful addition to her annual salary of xxxxx u winning a bonus for a third year was nt that important to her mrs yeargin insists x tx but others at greenville high say x she was eager x to win if not for money then for pride and recognition mary elizabeth ariail another socialstudies teacher says x she believed x mrs yeargin wanted x to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that txx would nt demand good hearing indeed mrs yeargin was interested in a possible job with the state teacher cadet program last march after x attending a teaching seminar in washington mrs yeargin says x she returned to greenville two days before annual testing x feeling that she had nt prepared her lowability geography students adequately when test booklets were passed x out xx hours ahead of time tx she says x she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students mrs yeargin admits x she made a big mistake but insists x her motives were correct i was trying x to help kids in an unfair testing situation she says tx only five of the xx questions were geography questions the rest were history sociology finance subjects x they never had tx mrs yeargin says that she also wanted x to help x lift greenville high school s overall test scores usually near the bottom of xx district high schools in rankings carried annually by local newspapers mostly she says x tx she wanted x to prevent the damage to selfesteem that her lowability students would suffer tx from doing badly on the test these kids broke my heart she says tx a whole day goes by and no one even knows x they re alive they desperately needed somebody who txx showed x they cared for them who txx loved them the last thing x they needed tx was another dragdown blow school officials and prosecutors say x mrs yeargin is lying they found students in an advanced class a year earlier who txx said x she gave them similar help although because the case was nt tried in court this evidence was never presented x publicly that pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out x to help the poor underprivileged child says joe watson the prosecutor in the case who txx is also president of greenville high school s alumni association mrs yeargin concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class x adding i wanted x to help all students mr watson says x mrs yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair do i have much sympathy for her mr watson asks tx i believe in the system i believe x you have x to use the system x to change it what she did txx was like taking the law into your own hands mrs ward says that when the cheating was discovered x tx she wanted x to avoid the moraledamaging public disclosure that a trial would bring tx she says x she offered mrs yeargin a quiet resignation and thought x she could help x save her teaching certificate she said something like you just want x to make it easy for the school i was dumbfounded mrs ward recalls tx it was like someone had turned a knife in me to the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests mrs yeargin won widespread local support the schoolboard hearing at which she was dismissed x tx was crowded x with students teachers and parents who txx came x to testify on her behalf supportive callers decried unfair testing not mrs yeargin on a local radio talk show on which she appeared tx the show did nt give the particulars of mrs yeargin s offense x saying only that she helped students do better on the test the message to the board of education out of all this is x we ve got x to take a serious look at how we re doing our curriculum and our testing policies tx in this state said tx the talkshow host editorials in the greenville newspaper allowed that mrs yeargin was wrong but also said x the case showed how testing was being overused x tx the radio show enraged us says tx mrs ward partly because of the show mr watson says x tx the district decided not x to recommend mrs yeargin for a firsttime offenders program that txx could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record and legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case over xx witnesses mostly students were interviewed x at greenville high school meanwhile some students especially on the cheerleading squad were crushed x it expx s hard to explain to a xxyearold why someone x they like tx had x to go says tx mrs ward soon tshirts ichx appeared in the corridors that tx carried the school s familiar redandwhite ghs logo on the front on the back the shirts read we have all the answers many colleagues are angry at mrs yeargin she did a lot of harm says tx cathryn rice who txxx had discovered the crib notes we work damn hard at what we do txxx for damn little pay and what she did tx cast unfair aspersions on all of us but several teachers also say x the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores says ichx gayle key a mathematics teacher the incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms there may be others doing what she did tx mrs yeargin says x she pleaded guilty because she realized x it expx would no longer be possible x to win reinstatement and because she was afraid of further charges mrs ward for one was relieved despite the strong evidence against mrs yeargin popular sentiment ichx was so strong ichx in her favor mrs ward says x tx that i m afraid x a jury would nt have convicted her since chalk first touched slate schoolchildren have wanted x to know what s tx on the test these days students can often find the answer in testcoaching workbooks and worksheets x their teachers give them tx in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests the mathematics section of the widely used california achievement test asks fifth graders what is tx another name for the roman numeral ix it also asks them x to add twosevenths and threesevenths worksheets in a testpractice kit called learning materials sold to schools across the country by macmillanmcgrawhill school publishing co contain

company macmillanmcgrawhill a joint venture of mcgrawhill inc and macmillan s parent britain s maxwell communication corp close parallels between tests and practice tests are common some educators and researchers say x tx testpreparation booklets software and worksheets are a booming publishing subindustry but some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say x they represent a form of schoolsponsored cheating if i took lcb these preparation booklets rcb into my classroom i d have a hard time x justifying to my students and parents that it was nt cheating says tx john kaminski a traverse city mich teacher who txxx has studied test coaching he and other critics say x such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests which txxx is to gauge learning

history says tx john cannell an albuquerque nm psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization friends for education which txxx has studied standardized testing standardized

scores he also asserted that exact questions were nt replicated x when referred x to the questions that txxx matched tx he said x it was coincidental mr kaminski the schoolteacher and william mehrens a michigan state university education professor concluded in a study last june that cat test versions of scoring high and learning materials should nt be used x in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test they devised a xxpoint scale x awarding one point for each subskill measured on the cat test x to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifthgrade cat because many of these subskills the symmetry of geometrical figures metric measurement of volume or pie and bar graphs for example are only a small part of the total fifthgrade curriculum mr kaminski says x tx the preparation kits would nt replicate too many if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures but learning materials matched on xxx of xx subskills scoring high matched on xxx in cat sections where students knowledge of twoletter consonant sounds is tested x tx the authors noted that scoring high concentrated on the same sounds that the test does tx to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know tx learning materials for the fifthgrade contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items rick brownell senior editor of scoring high says that messrs kaminski and mehrens are ignoring the need x students have tx for becoming familiar with tests and testing format he said x authors of scoring high scrupulously avoid x replicating exact questions but he does nt deny that some items are similar when scoring high first came out in xxxx tx it was a publication of random house in a xxxx advisory to educators mcgrawhill said x scoring high should nt be used x because it represented a parallel form of the cat and ctbs tests but in xxxx mcgrawhill purchased the random house unit

transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as alzheimer s parkinson s and huntington s but antiabortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of therapies using fetaltissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions james mason assistant secretary for health said x the ban on federal funding of fetaltissue transplant research should be continued x indefinitely he said x the ban wo nt stop privately funded tissuetransplant research or federally funded fetaltissue research that txxx does nt involve transplants department officials say that hhs secretary louis sullivan will support dr mason s ruling which txxx will be issued x soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the national institutes of health both dr mason and dr sullivan oppose federal funding for abortion as does president bush except in cases where a woman s life is threatened x tx the controversy began in xxxx when the national institutes of health aware of the policy implications of its research asked for an hhs review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from parkinson s disease tx the department placed a moratorium on the research pending a review of scientific legal and ethical issues a majority of an nihappointed panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions but the issue became embroiled x in politics as antiabortion groups continued x to oppose federal funding the dispute has hampered the administration s efforts to recruit prominent doctors x tx to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the nih and the centers for disease control several candidates have withdrawn their

reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion dr novello is deputy director of the national institute of child health and human development some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts earlier this week dr sullivan tried x to defuse these charges by x stressing that candidates x tx to head the nih and the cdc will be judged x by standards of scientific and administrative excellence not politics but the administration s handling of the fetaltissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists when scientific progress moves into uncharted ground tx there has x to be a role ichx for society to make judgments about its applications says tx myron genel associate dean of the yale medical school the disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized x so that no mechanism ichx exists for finding a middle ground yale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetaltissue transplants but dr genel warns that dr mason s ruling may discourage private funding the unavailability of federal funds and the climate in which the decision was made x tx certainly do nt provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support he said tx despite the flap over transplants federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that txxx cause cancer or to regulate genes that txxx cause

txxx first sounded here in xxxx but there is also a discordant modern note in aslacton though it ca nt be heard xxx by the churchgoers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening like most of the other xxxx churches in britain with sets of bells st michael once had its own band of ringers who txxx would herald every sunday morning and evening service now only one local ringer ichx remains xxyearold derek hammond the others here today live elsewhere they belong to a group of xx ringers including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training who txxx drive every sunday from church to church in a sometimesexhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of east anglia x to ring for even one service at this tower we have x to scrape says tx mr hammond a retired waterauthority worker we ve tried x to train the youngsters but they have their discos and their dances and they just drift away mr hammond worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the east anglian group that txxx keeps the aslacton bells pealing history after all is not on his side according to a nationwide survey taken a year ago nearly a third of england s church bells are no longer rung x on sundays because there is no one x tx to ring them it expx is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes tx the less complicated version of playing tunes on bells as do the carillons of continental europe is considered by the english xxx to be childish fit only for foreigners changeringing a mindboggling exercise x the english invented tx xxx years ago requires physical dexterity some bells weigh more than a ton combined with intense mental concentration proper english bells are started x off in rounds from the highestpitched bell to the lowest a simple descending scale using in larger churches as many as xx bells then at a signal the ringers begin x varying the order in which the bells sound tx without altering the steady rhythm of the striking each variation or change can occur only once the rules state x tx ringers memorize patterns of changes known as methods which txxx have oddsounding names like kent treble bob major or grandsire caters a series of xxxx or so changes is a peal and takes about three hours a look at a thursday night practice at st mary abbot church in the kensington district of london gives an idea of the work involved ten shirtsleeved ringers stand in a circle one foot ahead of the other in a prizefighter s stance each pulling a rope that txxx disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber no one speaks and the snaking of the ropes seems x to make as much sound as the bells themselves x muffled x by the ceiling x totally absorbed the ringers stare straight ahead x using peripheral vision lrb they call it ropesight rrb x to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls far above in the belfry the huge bronze bells mounted on wheels swing madly through a full xxx degrees x starting and ending surprisingly in the inverted or mouthup position skilled ringers use their wrists x to advance or retard the next swing so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change in a wellknown detectivestory involving church bells english novelist dorothy l sayers described ringing as a passion lcb that rcb tx finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection ringers she added x tx are filled x with the solemn intoxication that txxx comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed ringing does become a bit of an obsession admits tx stephanie pattenden master of the band at st mary abbot and one of england s best female ringers it is a passion that txxx usually stays in the tower however more often than not ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry when their changes are completed xxx tx and after they have worked up a sweat ringers often skip off to the local pub x leaving worship for others below this does not sit well with some clerics with membership of the church of england steadily dwindling strongwilled vicars are pressing equally strongwilled and often nonreligious ringers to attend services two years ago the rev jeremy hummerstone vicar of great torrington devon got so fed up with ringers who txxx did nt attend service x he sacked the entire band the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest they were a selfperpetuating club that txxx treated the tower as sort of a separate premises the vicar hummerstone says tx an entirely new band ichx rings today at great torrington several of whom tx are members of the congregation but there still are nt enough ringers x tx to ring more than six of the eight bells at st mary s church in ilminster somerset the bells have fallen x silent following a dustup over church attendance the vicar wd jones refuses x to talk about it x saying x it would reopen the wound but cjb marshall vicar of a nearby church feels x the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that tx are located xxx next to the altar so crunch crunch crunch bang bang bang here come tx the ringers from above x making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer he says tx vicar marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue since he is both a vicar and an active bellringer himself the sound of bells is a net x tx to draw people into the church he says tx i live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn xxx into that fuller life the central council of church bell ringers a sort of parliament of ringing groups aims x to improve relations with vicars says x tx john c baldwin president it hopes x to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled the bells in your care says ichx mr baldwin we recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience mr baldwin is also attacking the greater problem lack of ringers one survey says that of the xxxxxx trained bellringers in england today only xxxxx of them still ring also ringers do nt always live where the bells need x to be rung xxx tx like in small rural parishes and innercity churches but the council s program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful says x tx mr baldwin right now we re lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of xx he adds tx one bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once maledominated field more than a third of the ringers today are women they are nt accepted x everywhere however the oldest bellringing group in the country the ancient society of college youths founded in xxxx remains maleonly a fact that txxx s particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for britain s most prestigious churches st paul s cathedral and westminster abbey this being britain no woman has filed an equalopportunity suit but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to the ringing world a weekly newspaper for ringers one writer signing his letter as redblooded balanced male remarked on the frequency of women fainting in peals and suggested that they settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings in the torrent of replies that tx followed one woman ringer from solihull observed that the average male ringer leaves quite a lot x tx to be desired xxx x badly dressed decorated with acne and a large beerbelly frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals another women wrote from sheffield x to say that in her xx years of ringing i have never known a lady to faint in the belfry i have seen one or two men die bless them investors unsettled by the stock market s gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of quarterly dividend checks that has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than xx but do nt breathe too easy those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices some analysts warn x tx in the past they say x tx the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stockmarket party was almost over tx that can be a trap for unwary investors says x tx richard bernstein senior quantitative analyst at merrill lynch co strong dividend growth he says x tx is the black widow of valuation a reference to the female spiders that txxx attract males and then kill them after mating stephen boesel president of t rowe price growth and income fund explains that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time invariably those strong periods in the economy give way to recessionary environments he says tx and recessionary environments are nt hospitable to the stock market indeed analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical peaks tx in xxxx for example dividends on the stocks in standard poor s xxxstock index soared xx following much slower growth the year before the sp index started x sliding in price in september xxxx and fell xx in xxxx despite a xx expansion in dividends that year that pattern has nt always held but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious payouts on the sp xxx stocks rose xx in xxxx according to standard poor s corp and wall street estimates for xxxx growth are generally between x and xx u many people believe x the growth in dividends will slow next year although a minority see doubledigit gains continuing meanwhile many market watchers say x recent dividend trends raise another warning flag while dividends have risen smartly their expansion has nt kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices as a result the market s dividend yield dividends as a percentage of price has slid to a level that txxx is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards put x another way the decline in the yield suggests x stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends x they pay tx some market analysts say x tx they are keeping a close watch on the yield on the sp xxx the figure is currently about xx up from xx before the recent market slide some analysts say x investors should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below x a drop below that x benchmark has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued x says x tx mr boesel of t rowe price in fact the market has always tanked there s never been an exception says x tx gerald w perritt a chicago investment adviser and money manager based on a review of six decades of stockmarket data the last time x the sp xxx yield dropped below x tx was in the summer of xxxx stockholders who txxx took the hint and sold shares escaped the october debacle there have been only seven other times in xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx and xxxx when the yield on the sp xxx dropped below x for at least two consecutive months tx mr perritt found x tx and in each case he says x tx a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year still some market analysts say x the current xx reading is nt as troublesome as it might have been in years past it s not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner says tx james h coxon head of stock investments for cigna corp the philadelphiabased insurer in particular mr coxon says x tx businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow ichx in the form of dividends than they have historically so while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength rather than x increasing dividends some companies have used cash x to buy back some of their shares notes x tx steven g einhorn cochairman of the investment policy committee at goldman sachs co he factors that into the market yield x to get an adjusted yield of about xx that is just a tad below the average of the past xx years or so he says x tx what txxx will happen to dividend growth next year common wisdom suggests a singledigit rate of growth reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits painewebber inc for instance is forecasting growth in sp xxx dividends of just under x in xxxx down from an estimated xx this year in other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns the environment x the firm expects tx in xxxx tx the change in dividends ranged from a gain of x to a decline of x according to painewebber analyst thomas doerflinger the minority argument meanwhile is that businesses have the financial wherewithal ichx this time around x to declare sharply higher dividends tx even if their earnings weaken dividend growth on the order of xx is expected xxx by both mr coxon of cigna and mr einhorn of goldman sachs those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of x having plenty of cash left over after x paying dividends and making capital expenditures one indicator x investors might want x to watch tx is the monthly tally from standard poor s of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends a total of xxx companies ichx raised dividends in october basically unchanged from xxx a year ago sp said x tx wednesday that followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the yearearlier pace tx while the sp tally does nt measure the magnitude of dividend changes a further slippage in the number of dividend increases could be a harbinger of slower dividend growth next year in any case opinion ichx is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get tx even if dividend growth continues at doubledigit levels mr einhorn of goldman sachs estimates x the stock market will deliver a xx to xx u total return from appreciation and dividends ichx over the next xx months vs a cash rate of return of perhaps x or x u if dividend growth is weak but mr boesel of t rowe price who txxx also expects xx growth in dividends next year does nt think x it will help the overall market all that much having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook but i do nt think x it s a main consideration he says tx with slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year i would nt look for the market to have much upside from current levels your oct xx pageone story on the renewed plight of western

vote for it while the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged xxx at half the average us manufacturing wage the level of xxx u an hour in xxxx will still be less than xx of average factory pay mr williams said x tx but rep marge roukema lrb r nj rrb instead praised the house s acceptance of a new youth training wage a subminimum that gop administrations have sought tx for many years adopting a trainingwage policy means getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage mrs roukema said x tx policy makers regard the youth wage as helping x to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage but they have lately touted it as necessary x to help x impart job skills to entrants into the work force labor unions and democrats long fought the idea but recently acceded to it in the face of bush administration insistence the compromise sets the training wage at xxx u an hour next april and at xxx u an hour or xx of the minimum wage in april xxxx employers can pay the subminimum for xx days without restriction to workers with less than six months of job experience not and for another xx days if the company uses a governmentcertified training program for the young workers the training wage covers only workers who txxx are xx to xx years old the white house previously insisted on an unrestricted sixmonth training wage that tx could be paid xxx any time x a worker of any age took a new job tx the us chamber of commerce x still opposed to any mininumwage increase said x the compromise plan to lift the wage floor xx in two stages between april xxxx and

northern nekoosa corp nekoosa has given the offer a public cold shoulder a reaction x mr hahn has nt faced tx in his xx earlier acquisitions all of which tx were negotiated x behind the scenes so far mr hahn is trying x to entice nekoosa into negotiating a friendly surrender while x talking tough we are prepared x to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction he says tx but a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war with all x that implies tx if a competitor enters the game for example mr hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival x given x that choice associates of mr hahn and industry observers say x the former university president who tx has developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything would fold there s a price above which i m positive x marshall has the courage x not to pay tx tx says tx ad correll georgiapacific s executive vice president for pulp and paper says ichx longtime associate jerry griffin vice president corporate development at wtd industries inc he is nt of the old school of winning at any cost he also is a consensus manager insiders say x tx the decision to make the bid for nekoosa for example was made x only after all six members of georgiapacific s management committee signed onto the deal even though mr hahn knew x he wanted x to go after the company early on says x tx mr correll associates say x mr hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of virginia polytechnic institute x assuming that post at the age of xx he managed by consensus as is the rule in universities says x tx warren h strother a university official who tx is researching a book on mr hahn but he also showed a willingness x to take a strong stand

hahn had met tx while x fundraising for the institute in xxxx mr pamplin enticed mr hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals the move befuddled many in georgiapacific who tx did nt believe x a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world but mr hahn rose swiftly through the ranks x demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says x he knew x he possessed tx early on x the son of a physicist mr hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates x moving rapidly through school he graduated phi beta kappa from the university of kentucky at age xx after spending only x xx years in college he earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the massachusetts institute of technology mr hahn agrees that he has a retentive memory but friends say x that s an understatement they call it photographic mr hahn also has engineered a surprising turnaround of georgiapacific x taking over as chief executive officer in xxxx he inherited a company that tx was mired x in debt and hurt x by a recessioninspired slide in its buildingproducts business mr hahn began x selling noncore businesses such as oil and gas and chemicals he even sold one unit that tx made vinyl checkbook covers at the same time he began x building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while x refocusing building products on home repair and remodeling rather than materials for newhome construction the idea was to buffet building products from cycles in newhome construction the formula has paid off so far georgiapacific s sales climbed to xx billion u last year compared with x billion u in xxxx when mr hahn took the reins tx profit from continuing operations has soared to xxx million u from xx million u mr hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows tx best the record of companies that tx have diversified is nt all that impressive he says tx nekoosa would nt be a diversification it would be a good match mr hahn and many analysts say x tx of two healthy companies with highquality assets and strong cash flows the resulting company would be the largest forestproducts concern in the world with combined sales of more than xx billion u but can mr hahn carry it off in this instance industry observers say x tx he is entering uncharted waters says ichx kathryn mcauley an analyst at first manhattan co this is the greatest acquisition challenge x he has faced tx a housesenate conference approved major portions of a package for more than xxx million u in economic aid for poland that tx relies heavily on xxx million u in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal xxxx in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment for the agency for international development appropriators approved xxx million u in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program and total loan guarantees for the overseas private investment corp are increased x by xx million u over fiscal xxxx as part of the same poland package the conference approved at least xx million u in direct cash and development assistance as well and though no decision was made x both sides are committed to adding more than xxx million u in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the bush administration the agreement on poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill which tx has already provoked veto threats by the white house and is sharply confined under this year s budget these fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the poland package and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on us aid to eastern europe x to accommodate the additional cash assistance the house appropriations committee last week was required x to reallocate an estimated xxx million u from the pentagon and though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant recent experience with a similar program in central america indicates that it could take several years before the new polish government can fully use the aid effectively the action on poland came as the conference separately approved xxx million u for international population planning activities an xx increase over fiscal xxxx the house and senate are divided x over whether the united nations population fund will receive any portion of these appropriations but the size of the increase is itself significant in a second area of common concern the world environment an additional xx million u ichx will be provided x in development assistance x tx to fund a series of initiatives related both to global warming and the plight of the african elephant the sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments running from an import exemption for a california airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of panama s quota of exports to the profitable us market panama was stripped x of this right because of us differences with the noriega regime but the central american country would have received a quota of xxxxx metric tons over a xxmonth period ending sept xx xxxx about a quarter of this share has already been reallocated x according to the industry but the remaining xxxxx tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current us price of xx cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate the potential sales are nearly xx million u and house majority whip william gray lrb d pa rrb began the bidding this year by x proposing language that the quota be allocated xx to englishspeaking countries of the caribbean such as jamaica and barbados rep jerry lewis a conservative californian added a provision of his own intended to assist bolivia and the senate then broadened the list further by x including all countries in the us caribbean basin initiate as well as the philippines x backed by the powerful hawaii democrat sen daniel inouye jamaica wary of upsetting its caribbean basin allies has apparently instructed its lobbyist x to abandon the provision initially drafted by mr gray but the greater question is whether mr inouye who txx has strong ties to the sugar industry is able x to insert a claim by the philippines in separate floor action the house waived budget restrictions and gave quick approval to xxx billion u in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and antidrug programs in fiscal xxxx the funding is attached xx to an estimated xxx billion u transportation bill that tx goes ichx next to the senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all us domestic airline flights the leadership hopes x to move the compromise measure promptly to the white house but in recent days the senate has been as likely x to bounce bills back to the house the most recent example was a nearly xxx billion u fiscal xxxx bill funding the state justice and commerce departments and after x losing a battle tuesday night with the senate foreign relations committee appropriators from both houses are expected x to be forced xx back to conference beauty takes backseat to safety on bridges everyone agrees that most of the nation s old bridges

not effective or cost efficient the labor department cited usx corp for numerous health and safety violations at two pennsylvania plants and proposed xx million u in fines the largest penalty ever proposed for alleged workplace violations by an employer the department s occupational safety and health administration proposed fines of xx million u for alleged violations at the company s fairless hills pa steel mill that was a record for proposed penalties at any single facility osha cited nearly xxxx alleged violations of federal electrical cranesafety recordkeeping and other requirements a second citation covering the company s clairton pa coke works involved more than xxx alleged violations of electricalsafety and other requirements for which osha proposed xx million u in fines tx labor secretary elizabeth dole said the magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched x only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which txx resulted from corporate indifference to worker safety and health and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards osha said x there have been three worker fatalities at the two plants in the past two years and xx deaths since xxxx gerard scannell the head of osha said x usx managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years yet have failed x to take necessary action to counteract the hazards particularly flagrant mrs dole said x tx are tx the company s numerous failures to properly record injuries at its fairless works in spite of the firm promise x it had made tx in an earlier corporatewide settlement agreement to correct such discrepancies that settlement was in april xxxx a usx spokesman said x the company had nt yet received any documents ichx from osha regarding the penalty or fine once we do they will receive very serious evaluation the spokesman said tx no consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees usx said x it has been cooperating with osha since the agency began x investigating the clairton and fairless works he said that if and when safety problems were identified xx tx they were corrected xx the usx citations represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by osha under mr scannell he has promised stiffer fines though the size of penalties sought by osha have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year the big problem is that usx management has proved x unwilling x to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to safeguarding safety and health in the plants said tx linda anku osha regional administrator in philadelphia usx has xx working days x to contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent occupational safety and health review commission tx before the usx case osha s largest proposed fine for one employer was xx million u for alleged safety violations at john morrell co a meatpacking subsidiary of united

homeless population we have made no such statement it expx is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless the causes of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case in quoting from our research you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism you did not note that the homeless people x we examined tx had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse they suffered from malnutrition chest diseases cardiovascular disorders skin problems infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape homeless people not only lack safety privacy and shelter they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition cleanliness and basic health care in a recent report the institute of medicine pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness others may be a consequence of it and a third category is composed xx of disorders whose treatment txx is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter the interactions between health and homelessness are complex x defying sweeping generalizations as to cause or effect if we look to the future preventing homelessness is an important objective this will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess an understanding that tx can be developed xx only through careful study and research william r breakey md pamela j fischer md department of psychiatry johns hopkins university school of medicine baltimore a study by tulane prof james wright says x homelessness is due to a complex array of problems with the common thread of poverty the study shows that nearly xx of the homeless population is made up xx of women and children and that only xx of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug alcohol and mental problems according to dr wright homelessness is simultaneously a housing problem an employment problem a demographic problem a problem of social disaffiliation a mental health problem a family violence problem a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level leighton

convenient assertion could be made xx tx robert s jenkins cambridge mass of the approximately xxx sponsors of the recent march in washington for the homeless you chose x to cite such groups as the national association of home builders and the international union of bricklayers and allied craftsmen x insinuating that the march got its major support from selfserving groups that tx know a good

your paper why did nt you mention the ymca or the ywca or catholic charities usa or a hundred other nonprofit organizations that txx participated in the march tx as for the findings on the xxx baltimore homeless who txx underwent psychiatric examinations i suggest x you conduct your own survey choose xxx business executives including perhaps someone from your own staff and put them out on

legislation designed to make it easier for the transportation department to block airline leveraged buyouts the final vote came after the house rejected republican efforts to weaken the bill and approved two amendments sought by organized labor the bush administration has threatened x to veto such a bill because of what it views tx as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry but the xxxxxx vote suggests that supporters have the potential x to override a veto tx the broader question is where the senate stands tx on the issue while the senate commerce committee has approved legislation similar to the house bill on airline leveraged buyouts the measure has nt yet come to the full floor although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline it is aimed xx at giving the transportation department the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt the purpose of the bill is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that tx would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier s ability to compete rep john paul hammerschmidt lrb r ark rrb said tx the bill as it was approved xx by the house public works and transportation committee would give the transportation department up to xx days x to review any purchase of xx or more of the stock in an airline tx the department would be required x to block the buyout if the acquisition is likely x to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired xx its ability to compete would be sharply diminished x it would be put xx into foreign control or if the transaction would result in the sale of airlinerelated assets unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit the house approved an amendment offered by rep peter defazio lrb d ore rrb that tx would in addition to the previous criteria also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely x to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier s employees or their wages or benefits rep james traficant lrb d ohio rrb said x the amendment which txx passed xxxxxx would let the american worker know that we consider them occasionally but rep hammerschmidt said that the provision which he dubbed tx a special interest amendment was likely x to make the bill even more controversial on tuesday the house approved a laborbacked amendment that tx would require the transportation department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines ichx previously that tx have filed for protection from creditors under chapter xx of the federal bankruptcy code the provision called the twotimelosers amendment by its supporters apparently was aimed xx at preventing texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo from x attempting to take over another airline you now may drop by the voice of america offices in washington and read the text of what the voice is broadcasting tx to those xxx million people around the world who txx tune in to it each week you can even take notes extensive notes for the voice folks wo nt look over your shoulder about what you read tx you can do all this even if you re not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of congress and my newspaper can print the text of those broadcasts until the other day you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy had no right to see what your government was telling your cousins around the world txx that was the law and i apparently had no right to print hither what the voice was booming tx to yon and it was stupid the theory was that the voice is a propaganda agency and this government should nt propagandize its own people that sounds neat but this government any government propagandizes its own people every day government press releases speeches briefings tours of military facilities publications are all propaganda of sorts propaganda is just information x tx to support a viewpoint and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue the restrictions on viewing and dissemination of voice material were especially absurd an agency in the information business was not being allowed x to inform in june xxxx i wrote in this space about this issue x assuming x it was nt one of those columns that you clipped tx and put tx on the refrigerator door i ll review the facts the voice of america is a government agency that tx broadcasts news and views some might say propaganda in xx languages to xxx million listeners around the world it does a firstrate job its budget xxx million u is paid for xx by you but a xxxx law barred the dissemination of that material in the us the law let scholars reporters and researchers read texts of voa material only at voa headquarters in washington but it barred them from x copying texts and of course there s that word dissemination how s that tx again you may come by the agency x to read but not copy either manually or by photocopying a voice official explained tx when i asked tx what if i tune in my shortwave radio transcribe an editorial or program and print it in my newspaper nor are you free x to reprint such material i was advised xx tx that sounded a lot like censorship so after years of letters and conversations that txx went nowhere i sued a couple of weeks ago i lost the case in federal district court in des moines at least that s the way x it was reported xx tx and indeed the lawsuit was dismissed xx but i i like x to think of it in terms of we all of us won the point for a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling the united states information agency which txx runs the voice changed its position on three key points the usia said that on reflection of course i could print anything x i could get my hands on tx the word dissemination it decided x tx referred only to itself the usia officially and publicly declared the absolute right ichx of everyone except the usia to disseminate agency program materials in the united states my lawyer the scholarly mark mccormick of des moines said tx in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that i had lost the court noted the new usia position but just in case officially found that congress did not intend x to preclude plaintiffs from disseminating usia information domestically the usia said that on reflection anyone ichx could view the voa materials not just the reporters scholars researchers and congressmen who tx are mentioned xx in the statute the usia publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed xx access to the materials notwithstanding the statutory designations because the usia has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and requesting to see the materials mr mccormick noted tx and the usia said that all of us could take extensive notes the agency publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that persons who txx examine the materials may make notes and while the agency position is that persons may not take verbatim notes no one will check x to determine what notes a person has taken txx mr mccormick reported tx i had sought in my suit the right to print voice material which tx had been denied me xx and i had sought a right to receive the information x arguing in effect that a right to print government information is nt very helpful if i have no right to get the information but the court disagreed the first amendment proscribes the government from x passing laws abridging the right to free speech judge donald obrien ruled tx the first amendment does not prescribe a duty upon the government to assure easy access to information for members of the press so now the situation is this you have a right x to read voice of america scripts if you do nt mind x traveling to washington every week or so and x visiting the voice office during business hours i have a right x to print those scripts if i go there and laboriously but no longer surreptitiously copy them out in long hand but neither of us can copy the material on a xerox machine or have it sent x to us in an era when every government agency has a publicrelations machine that tx sends you stuff whether you want it or not tx this does seem odd indeed judge obrien ruled that it expx would be easy to conclude that the usia s position is inappropriate or even stupid but it s the law so the next step i suspect x tx is to try x to get the law changed we lrb i assume x you re in this with me at this point rrb need x to get three words for examination only eliminated from the law section xxx of the united states information and educational exchange act of xxxx says x voice material shall be available to certain of us lrb but now thanks to the usia s new position all of us rrb for examination only if those words were nt there the nice people at the voice would be able x to send you the information or at the very least let you photocopy it this is not a trivial issue you have raised important questions which txx ought x to be answered x what does usia say txx about america abroad how do we say it tx and how can american taxpayers get the answers to these questions tx a man wrote me tx a couple of years ago the man was charles z wick at the time he was director of the he had no answers then now there are some this democracy is suddenly a little more democratic i feel pretty good about it mr

analyst for prudentialbache in new york mr mcgovern was widely seen x as sales and not profit oriented new managers would think a little more like wall street mr mcmillin added tx some of the surge in

heads at the house possible candidates include susan petersen president of ballantinedel reyfawcett random house s huge and successful paperback division some say x anthony cheetham head of a recently

took her job tx several important divisions that tx had reported to her predecessor were nt included x partly because she did nt wish x to be a fulltime administrator mr mehta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a lessthanbrilliant administrator and his own departure was rumored xx recently mr bernstein a tall energetic man who txx is widely respected as a publishing executive has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues congress learned during the reagan administration that it could intimidate the executive branch by x uttering again and again the same seven words provided that no funds shall be spent xx this phrase once again is found xx throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through congress it signals congress s attempt under the pretext of guarding the public purse to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in article ii of the constitution this species of congressional action is predicated xx on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that tx is erroneous and unconstitutional the appropriations clause states that no money shall be drawn xx from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law the prevailing interpretation of the clause on capitol hill is that it gives congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding this interpretation was officially endorsed x by congress in xxxx in the irancontra report as partisans of congressional power understand a power of the purse so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers it is not supported by the text or history of the constitution the framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the constitutional convention of xxxx according to madison s notes to the extent x they did their concern was x to ensure fiscal accountability moreover the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources x to perform the executive functions that the confederation congress had performed tx poorly under the articles of confederation tx it would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause lrb technically a limitation on legislative power rrb could be read xx as xx placing the president on congress s short leash xx making the executive consist of the president and every member of congress as it went to the conference panel now deliberating the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal xxxx contained some breathtaking attempts ichx by congress to rewrite the constitution under the pretext of protecting the public s money during the coming weeks president bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them or alternatively to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of article ii and thus void and severable the xxxx appropriations legislation attempts x to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided x by article ii article ii places on the president the duty to nominate rnrx and by and with the advice and consent of the senate appoint rnrx ambassadors judges and other officers of the us it also empowers the president to make recess appointments without senate approval the president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that tx may happen during the recess of the senate by x granting commissions which txx shall expire at the end of their next session yet section xxx of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides no part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other act shall be paid xx to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated xx tx after the senate has voted x not to approve the nomination of said person thus with one brief passage in an appropriations bill congress repeals the president s power to make recess appointments under article ii section xxx also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president s ability to nominate candidates of his choosing the language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied xx funding x to pay that person s salary tx the president could probably not avoid this restriction by x choosing people willing to serve without pay because the antideficiency act prohibits voluntary service to the government the xxxx appropriations bills also contain a number of muzzling provisions that tx violate the recommendation clause in article ii of the constitution muzzling provisions which tx might be called xx blindfold laws as well prevent the executive branch from even x looking at certain policy options let alone from x recommending them to congress such laws violate the provision in article ii that tx requires the president to make recommendations to congress but which txx gives the president the discretion x to select the subject matter of those recommendations tx typically these laws seek x to prevent executive branch officials from x inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more marketoriented alternatives to regulations probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that tx prevents the president s office of management and budget from x subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any costbenefit scrutiny there is something inherently suspect about congress s prohibiting the executive from x even studying whether public funds are being wasted xx in some favored program or other perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal xxxx better ichx illustrates congress s attempt to usurp executive power than section xxx of the executiveoffice bill none of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this act shall be used x to implement administer or enforce any regulation which tx has been disapproved xx pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the united states this provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president s execution of the law since a onehouse resolution could be said x to be duly adopted even though it would require neither bicameral action in congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto the supreme court s decision in ins v chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional president bush should veto appropriations acts that tx contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president s ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives if president bush fails x to do so in his first year he will invite congress for the remainder of his presidency x to rewrite article ii of the constitution x to suit its purposes what tx becomes custom in the bush administration will only become more difficult x for future presidents including democrats to undo tx president reagan learned that lesson by xxxx thenspeaker jim wright was discussing arms control in moscow with mikhail gorbachev and then attempting x to direct the president through an appropriations rider x to treat the soviets as though the senate had ratified salt ii if a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision x declaring the rider restricting his article ii powers to be unconstitutional and severable the constitution does not expressly give the president such power however the president does have a duty not to violate the constitution the question is whether his only means of defense is the veto excision of appropriations riders that tx trespass on the president s duties and prerogative under article ii would be different from the lineitem veto as discussed in the context of controlling federal spending the lineitem veto is characterized xx as a way x for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that tx are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives tx the excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability one could argue that it expx is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president by x exerting a power of excision to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that tx violate the separation of powers there is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal xxxx appropriations bills if congress does nothing president bush will have won if congress takes the dispute to the supreme court lrb x assuming x it can establish standing x to sue tx rrb president bush might win in that case he might receive an opinion ichx from the court that tx is a vindication of the president s right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives x the framers thought x tx should be entrusted xx to the executive if president bush loses at the court it might be disappointing as morrison v olson was for the reagan administration but the presidency would be no worse off than it is now moreover the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice tx as it stands now congress presumes after the reagan administration that the white house will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills x lying down president bush should set things straight if he does not he will help x realize madison s fear in the federalist no xx of a legislature everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex mr sidak served as an attorney in the reagan administration his longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is x to appear in the duke law journal later this year despite one of the most devastating droughts on record net cash income in the farm belt rose to a new high of xxx billion u last year the previous record was xxx billion u in xxxx according to the agriculture department net cash income the amount left in farmers pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income increased in xx states in xxxx as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices the department s economic research service reported x tx yesterday most of those states set farm income records the worst crop damage occurred in the midwestern corn belt and the northern great plains what txx saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had mortgaged tx to the government under pricesupport loan programs with prices soaring they were able x to sell the reclaimed commodities at considerable profit the agency s xxxpage report said x tx in less parched areas meanwhile farmers who txx had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices to the surprise of some analysts net cash income rose in some of the hardesthit states including indiana illinois nebraska and the dakotas analysts attributed the increases partly to the x billion u disasterassistance package enacted by congress last year s record net cash income confirms the farm sector s rebound from the agricultural depression of the early xxxxs it also helps x explain the reluctance ichx of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the xxxx farm program next year commodity prices have been rising in recent years with the farm price index hitting record peaks earlier this year as the government curtailed production with landidling programs x to reduce pricedepressing surpluses at the same time export demand for us wheat corn and other commodities strengthened said tx keith collins a department analyst farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices as the nation s cattle inventory dropped close to a xxyear low all of these forces came together in xxxx to benefit agriculture mr collins said tx california led the nation with xx billion u in net cash income last year followed by texas xx billion u iowa xx billion u florida xx billion u and minnesota xx billion u iowa and minnesota were among the few major farm states x tx to log a decline in net cash income despite federal disaster relief the drought of xxxx was a severe financial setback for an estimated xxxxx to xxxxx farmers according to the department many lost their farms department economists do nt expect xxxx to be as good a year as xxxx was indeed net cash income is likely x to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline at the same time an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn soybeans and other commodities causing a fall in prices that tx has been only partly cushioned x by heavy grain buying by the soviets last year government payments to farmers slipped to less than xxx billion u from a record xxx billion u in xxxx payments are expected x to range between x billion u and xx billion u this year after

riese says x tx until now however buyers who txx wanted x to finance part of a car purchase through general motors acceptance corp could nt put their down payment on a charge card because of possible

influential floor brokers long have earned fat returns of xx to xx u a year on their capital by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks the specialists see any step to electronic trading as a death knell and they believe x the big board under mr phelan has abandoned their interest x the son of a specialist and once one himself mr phelan has nonetheless been striving with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike tx so much x to keep index funds and other program traders from x taking their business to overseas markets meanwhile specialists trading risks have skyrocketed as a result of stockmarket volatility when the sell programs hit tx you can hear the order printers start x to go on the big board trading floor says x tx one specialist there the buyers walk away and the specialist is left xx alone as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks he contends x tx no one is more unhappy with program trading than the nation s stockbrokers they are still trying x to lure back small investors spooked by the xxxx stockmarket crash and the market s swings since then small investors are absolutely dismayed that wall street is stacking the deck against them and these wide swings are scaring them to death says tx raymond a mason chairman of regional broker legg mason inc in baltimore stockbrokers business and pay has been falling last year the average broker earned xxxxx u xx lower than in xxxx corporate executives resent that their company s stock has been transformed xx into a nameless piece of a stockindex basket index traders who txx buy all xxx stocks in the sp xxx often do nt even know what the companies x they own tx actually do tx complains x tx andrew sigler chairman of champion international corp do you make sweatshirts or sparkplugs oh you re in the paper business is one reaction x mr sigler says x he s gotten tx from his big institutional shareholders by this september program traders were doing a record xxx of the big board s average daily trading volume among the top practitioners were tx wall street blue bloods morgan stanley co kidder peabody merrill lynch salomon brothers inc and painewebber group inc but then came oct xx and the negative publicity orchestrated by the old guard particularly against index arbitrage the indexers strategy for the moment is to hunker down and let the furor die there s a lynchmob psychology right now says tx the top programtrading official at a wall street firm wall street s cash cow has been gored x but i do nt think x anyone has proven that index arbitrage is the problem too much money ichx is at stake for program traders to give up for example stockindex futures began trading in chicago in xxxx and within two years they were the fastestgrowing futures contract ever launched stock futures trading has minted dozens of millionaires in their xxs and xxs now on a good day chicago s stockindex traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the big board trades in stock now the stage is set xx for the battle to play out the antiprogrammers are getting some helpful thunder from congress program traders power to create total panic is so great that they ca nt be allowed x to have their way says x tx rep edward markey a massachusetts democrat we have x to have a system that tx says to those largest investors sit down you will not panic you will not put the financial system in jeopardy but the prospects for legislation that tx targets program trading is unlikely anytime soon many people including the big board think that it s too late to put the genie back in the bottle the big board s directors meet today x to approve some programtrading restrictions but a total ban is nt being considered xx big board officials say x tx you re not going x to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks says tx vanderbilt s prof stoll program trading is here x to stay and computers are here x to stay and we just need x to understand it short of a total ban some antiprogrammers have proposed several middleground reforms which they say x tx would take away certain advantages x program traders currently enjoy tx in the marketplace that other investors do nt tx one such proposal regarding stockindex futures is an increase in the margin requirement or the goodfaith payment of cash needed to trade them to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks currently margins on stock futures purchases are much lower roughly x compared with xx for stocks making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative program trading critics also want the federal reserve board rather than the futures industry to set such margins futures traders respond that low margins help x keep their markets active higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who txx help larger traders buy and sell they say tx another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an uptick rule a reform instituted after the great crash of xxxx that tx protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten x downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices namely short sellers the big board s uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price tx but in xxxx program traders received what txx amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations to make it expx easier to link the stock and futures markets a reinstatement of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably program traders argue that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the pricing efficiency of the futures and stock markets james a white contributed to this article big board chairman john phelan said yesterday that he could support letting federal regulators suspend program trading during wild stockprice swings thus the bandwagon psychology of recent days picks up new impetus index arbitrage is a common form of program trading as usually practiced x it takes advantage of a rather basic concept two separate markets in different locations trading basically the same widgets ca nt trade them for long at prices that txx are widely different in index arbitrage the widget is the sp xxx and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in chicago and the stock markets largely in new york x to profit from an indexarbitrage opportunity someone who txx owns the sp xxx widget in new york must sell it and replace it with a cheaper sp xxx widget in chicago if the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients xx to match or beat the return of the sp xxx index he is likely x to remain fully invested at all times lrb few if any indexfund managers will risk x leveraging performance by x owning more than xxx exposure to stocks and equally few will want x to own less than a xxx position should stocks rise rrb by x constantly seeking x to own the cheapest widget indexarbitrage traders hope x to add between x and x u to the annual return of the sp xxx that represents a very thin excess return certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim x to seek tx as their performance objective the fact that a vast majority of fundamentalist money managers fail x to beat the sp xxx may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue as more managers pursue the indexarbitrage strategy these small opportunities between markets will be reduced x and eventually eliminated x the current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that txx make up the sp xxx is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market the new york stock exchange s attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares so if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget how did program trading evolve into the evil creature that tx is evoking the curses of so many observers tx all arguments against program trading even those pressed without fact conclude with three expected results after reforms are implemented x x rrb reduced volatility x rrb a longterm investment focus and x rrb a level playing field for the small investor but many of these reforms are unneeded even harmful an indexarbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in new york and chicago x tx to cover all transaction costs arbitrage does nt cause volatility it responds to it think about what tx causes the difference in prices between the two markets for sp xxx stocks usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in chicago a large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his futures tx arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from chicago to new york while x functioning as a buyer in chicago the start of the whole process is the key someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in widgets x to make widget prices move why does this large hypothetical seller trade in chicago instead of new york tx perhaps he is willing x to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order x to get quick and certain execution of his large trade in a competitive market this investor has many ways x to execute his transactions tx and he will have more alternatives lrb both foreign and domestic rrb if his volume is profitable x for an exchange to handle tx if not chicago then in new york if not the us then overseas volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising creating more volatility instead of less the speed of his transaction is nt x to be feared xx either because faster and cleaner execution is desirable not loathsome if slowing things down could reduce volatility stone tablets should become the trade ticket of the future encouraging longterm investing we must be very cautious about labeling investors as longterm or shortterm policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are akin to placing a sign ichx over the big board s door saying buyers welcome sellers please go away the ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term a free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks x he can tolerate tx in point of fact volatility as measured x by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change tx lrb xxxxxx xxxxxx and xxxxxx for example rrb it expx is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream foul on program trading when the markets decline tx while x hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks instead of the evil deeds of programtrading goblins some of the proposed fixes for what tx is labeled xx programtrading volatility could be far worse than the perceived problem in using program trading as a whipping boy fundamentalist investors stand x to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing stockselection products they may however risk x bringing some damaging interference from outside the markets themselves how does a nice new tax say x on any financial transaction sound tx that ought x to make sure x we re all thinking for the long term getting a level playing field this argument is perhaps the most interesting one for abolishing program trading not because of its merits but because of the firms championing the cause the loudest of these reformers are money managers who txx cater to smaller investors they continually advise their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell tx while their clients continue x to hope for superior performance even with mutual funds the little investor continues x to tolerate high fees high commissions and poor performance while indexfund managers slowly amass a better record with lower fees lower commissions and less risk yet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of an investment expert studiously devouring press clippings on each company x he follows tx almost all new regulation is introduced xx in the interests of protecting the little guy and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences if spreads available from index arbitrage are so enormous surely any sizable mutualfund company could profit from offering it to small investors the sad reality is that the retail investor continues x to pursue stellar performers first while x leaving institutions to grapple with basis points of performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter ppax costeffective index funds just are nt sexy enough to justify the high fees and commissions that retail customers frequently pay tx and that institutional customers refuse x to pay tx each new trading roadblock is likely x to be beaten xx by institutions seeking better ways x to serve their highvolume clients tx here or overseas legislating new trading inefficiencies will only make things harder on the least sophisticated investors so what txx is next for program trading x left x to its own devices index arbitrage will become more and more efficient x making it harder and harder x to do tx profitably spreads will become so tight that it wo nt matter which market an investor chooses txx arbitrage will prevent him from x gaining any temporary profit if government or private watchdogs insist however on introducing greater friction between the markets lrb limits on price moves twotiered execution higher margin requirements taxation etc rrb the end loser will be the markets themselves instead we ought x to be inviting more liquidity with cheaper ways x to trade and transfer capital among all participants tx mr allen s pittsburgh firm advanced investment

he added that the currentcarrying capacity of multicrystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of socalled weak links between crystals such multicrystal materials will probably be needed x for commercial applications mr van dover said x the att team created the desired crystal changes by x bombarding superconductor samples with neutrons a process that tx creates some radioactivity in the samples and may not be feasible for largescale commercial use still scientists breathed a collective sigh of relief about the finding because it demonstrates how to overcome the flux pinning problem that tx earlier this year was widely publicized as undercutting new superconductors potential tx the problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals limiting their currentcarrying capacity mr van dover said x the crystal changes x his team introduced tx apparently pins the magnetic fields in place preventing them from x lowering currentcarrying capacity mr van dover added that researchers are trying x to determine precisely what crystal changes tx solved the problem determining that may enable them to develop better ways x to introduce the needed crystallattice patterns tx the att team also is trying x to combine their latest superconductor process with melttextured growth a process discovered earlier at bell

banking activities are rising as revenue from the industry s traditional business erodes the downgrading of debt issued by cs first boston inc parent of first boston corp by moody s investors service inc coupled with a moody s announcement that shearson lehman hutton holdings inc is under review for a possible downgrade sent shivers through the brokerage community this week with the shudders came tx the realization that some of wall street s biggest players are struggling x to maintain the stellar credit standing required to finance their activities profitably securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper or shortterm corporate ious which they sell tx x to finance their daily operations the biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper but moody s warned that shearson s commercial paper rating could be lowered x soon a move that tx would reduce shearson s profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms shearson

vice president a sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible standard poor s corp says x first boston shearson and drexel burnham lambert inc in particular are likely x to have difficulty x shoring up their credit standing in months ahead what tx worries creditrating concerns the most is that wall street firms are taking longterm risks with their own capital via leveraged buyout and junk bond financings that s a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors whereas conventional securities financings are structured x to be sold x quickly wall street s new penchant for leveraged buyouts and junk bonds is resulting in longterm lending commitments that tx stretch out for months or years the recent disarray in the junk bond market

warning flag for the industry in april when it downgraded cs first boston tx wall street is facing a catchxx situation says tx mr mahoney of moody s merchant banking where firms commit their own money tx is getting riskier and there s less of it x tx to go around in addition he says tx ichx the buyout business is under pressure because of the junk bond collapse meaning that returns are likely x to

debt will be paid x with funds generated by the acquired company s operations or sales of its assets in a recent report moody s said x it expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry which tx combined with overcapacity will create poor prospects for profitability it said that the temptation ichx for managements to ease this profit pressure by x taking greater risks is an additional rating factor both moody s and sp cited first boston s reliance in recent years on merchant banking which tx has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm s profit the recent cash squeeze at campeau corp first boston s most lucrative client of the decade is proving costly to first boston because it arranged more than x billion u of highyield highrisk junk financings for campeau units in addition a big loan that first boston made tx to ohio mattress co was nt repaid on time when its xxx million u junk financing for a buyout of

the last six months lewis c veraldi the father of the team that tx created the highly successful ford taurus and mercury sable cars retired early after x experiencing recent heart problems most recently mr veraldi xx years old has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at ford motor co but he is best known x in the auto industry as the creator of a team cardevelopment approach that tx produced the two midsized cars that tx were instrumental in helping the no x auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company s ford division to eclipse general motors corp s chevrolet division as the topselling nameplate in the us under the socalled team taurus approach mr veraldi and other ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers assemblyline workers auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle the concept s goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make ford s product development more responsive to consumer demands it was later applied to other newcar programs including those that tx produced the ford thunderbird and mercury cougar ford chairman donald e petersen said yesterday that mr veraldi has helped x to change the world s perception of americanmade cars mr veraldi worked at ford for xx years x holding a variety of car and partsengineering positions the limits to legal absurdity stretched another notch this week when the supreme court refused x to hear an appeal from a case that tx says x corporate defendants must pay damages even after x proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm we can understand and share the compassion that tx makes judges sometimes wish x to offer a kind of solomonic aid to those who tx ve been hurt x but this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policymaking process have left the courts as the only forum x this country has tx x to debate risk technology and innovation tx tx too often now a single court decision becomes the precedent for other less compelling cases from the xxxxs until xxxx some two million women took the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol lrb des rrb x to prevent miscarriages and morning sickness the drug was approved x by the food and drug administration and marketed x by some xxx pharmaceutical companies often under generic labels in the xxxxs scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of des users the cases quickly went to court but the mothers of several thousand des plaintiffs could nt recall whose brand they used tx beginning in xxxx courts in several states including california and new york decided x to suspend the commonlaw rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who tx are liable courts made the assumption that all des pills were essentially the same and created a marketshare test so that damages would be assessed x against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales this has some logic drug makers should nt be able x to duck liability because people could nt identify precisely which identical drug tx was used x but courts quickly tumbled down a slippery slope just as all plaintiffs are not alike it turns out that des defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties the ultimate result came in hymowitz v lilly where the highest new york court expanded the marketshare approach for the first time to say that drug makers that tx could prove x mindy hymowitz s mother did nt use their pill must still pay their share of any damages tx but as duke university law professor william van alstyne notes by this reasoning a defendant could be held x liable in new york for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in california despite the supreme court s refusal to hear the case there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants the big problem however is that there s no guarantee that this reasoning will be limited x to des or to drugs the problem here goes well beyond twisting legal doctrine the california supreme court last year reversed direction x to make it expx much harder to win des cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs tx the court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs x citing the huge hidden social costs public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs even though some risks perhaps serious ones might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering the unanimous court said tx the california justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining antimorningsickness drug bendectin off the us market this raises the key issue what to do tx about people who tx suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs we now know that holding drug makers liable where there s no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks tx only means x the drugs wo nt be available to anyone as liability expert peter huber tells us after the hymowitz case if any drug maker introduces an antimiscarriage drug it s time x to sell that company s stock short tx we also know that the tort system is a lousy way x to compensate victims tx anyway some win the legal lottery others get much less and contingencyfee lawyers take a big cut either way des daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken x out of the courts congress could create a compensation program x tx to help such victims while x protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs but a xxxx law that tx supposedly replaced lawsuits over children s vaccines with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation everyone by now understands that congress is utterly incapable of writing legislation x to help deserving people tx without its becoming some billiondollar morass we have no doubt x this is one reason x judges in new york and justices on the supreme court are willing x to trash the law in the des cases they must figure that justice has x to get done x by somebody but know x it wo nt be done x by congress odyssey partners limited partnership an investment firm completed the purchase of may department

recently harvested midwest crop to ports for loading onto soviet ships river barge rates have soared xx this fall from a year earlier railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business and some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate this month as exporters scrounge x to find enough of the crop x tx to meet their obligations to the soviets the soviet union bought roughly xxx million bushels of us corn ichx in october which tx is the most ever sold to the soviet union in one month from the us the soviet union wants much of it delivered x by january which tx would be a strain in most years but it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the mississippi river on which flows tx much of the us corn that tx is shipped x overseas we are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record said tx william dunton a us agriculture department transportation expert it is going x to be real tight because of persistent dry weather in the northern plains the water level on the upper section of the mississippi river is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges x their tows push tx at one time in a few weeks many barges probably wo nt be able x to operate fully loaded south of st louis because the us army corps of engineers is beginning x to reduce the flow of the missouri river which tx feeds into the mississippi river the army corps is cutting the flow of the missouri river about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs

best position of many years x to push up corn prices tx because the drought reduced us stockpiles they have more than enough storage space for their new crop and that permits them to wait for prices

reed president of chicago central pacific railroad co of waterloo iowa it expx is nt clear however who tx would win a waiting game although us corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the

industry s problems might spark investors to begin x buying corn futures contracts x only to see little appreciation the public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain x tx to be shipped x tx said tx bill biedermann allendale inc research director although much of this country s export corn goes to new orleans by barge it expx is possible for exporters to sidestep the mississippi river by x shipping a largerthannormal amount of corn by train to the port ports in the great lakes and atlantic coast can also relieve pressure on new orleans one railroad for example is already increasing its grain hauling service from indiana to baltimore and it expx is nt clear that the soviet union will stay on its record buying pace the soviet orders were compressed x into the
